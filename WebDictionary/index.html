		<p>You live a charmed life in Australia. The streets are safe, the weather is terrific, the people are friendly. The ocean keeps everything out. Or, at least, slows it down.</p>
		<p>We complain when a car costs $30,000 or a TV show won't hit our screens right away, but it's the distance that has allowed Australia to stay Australia in the face of relentless globalization. It's given us more than a decade in which to rethink our ideas on society and our way of life, and the trade-offs between freedom and security we're willing to make, without having to do so in the immediate aftermath of a national tragedy.</p>
		<p>If this hostage taker in Sydney had claimed to be acting for some other cause -- disgruntlement at the tax code, or the high price of cars -- we wouldn't call it terrorism. We would call it what it is: a lunatic with a gun. But that would overlook the deeper trend, which is that Australia's oceans are shrinking. Today technology allows a man to be more connected to militant extremists across the globe -- in spirit, if nothing else -- than he was to his neighbors in Bexley North. He can find and latch onto toxic ideas from the other side of the globe and bring them into Sydney.</p>
		<p>Whether we call it a siege or terrorism, it was something that used to happen Over There. And now it's here. It wasn't unexpected, and arrived more benignly than it could have, and today the country will get on with business as usual. But life is becoming a little less charmed. We are no longer so far away.</p>
